# 869-project
2019 Fall 6.869 Final Project


From 6.869 Project Description:
Report
The report should be 4 pages for 6.819, and 6 pages for 6.869 (the upper limit of 6 pages is strict!), including references in CVPR format. It should be structured like a research paper, with sections for Introduction, related work, the approach/algorithm, experimental results, conclusions and references. Project reports should be individually submitted and the contributions of each team member should be clearly described.

Regarding the reports:

Each student should submit an individual copy. All the members of the group can share figures and text. But each copy should have one section that will be individual and should describe the contribution made by the student.
The rest of the document can be identical across members.
Each copy should include the names of all the collaborators.
You should describe and evaluate what you did in your project, which may not necessarily be what you hoped to do originally. A small result described and evaluated well will earn more credit than an ambitious result where no aspect was done well. Be accurate in describing the problem you tried to solve. Explain in detail your approach, and specify any simplifications or assumptions you have taken. Also demonstrate the limitations of your approach. When doesnâ€™t it work? Why? What steps would you have taken have you continued working on it? Make sure to add references to all related work you reviewed or used.

You are allowed to submit any supplementary material that you think it important to evaluate your work, however we do not guarantee that we will review all of that material, and you should not assume that. The report should be self-contained.

Submission: submit your report to stellar as a pdf file named <your_kerberos>.pdf. Submit any supplementary material as a single zip file named <your_kerberos>.zip. Add a README file describing the supplemental content.
